# AirCombat

Once finish, I intend this game to be fun simple shooting game with ammo, different weapons, upgrades. I intend to allow the end-user to change any keybindings in the game, intend to allow pausing, and switching to other apps during the game (at which point the game itself shall become translucent. I intend to allow the user to adjust settings of the game, and be able to create their own weapons and enemies, along with being able to customize most everything in the game.

This game is my first experience using QT, and a way for me to practice doing so.
